abstract = {We present an efficient method to self-calibrate a quantum random number generator (RNG). The method is based on the measurements of the system in two mutually unbiased basis. Thanks to the uncertainty principle applied to min- and max- entropies, a lower bound of the achievable true randomness can be evaluated. We tested our method with two different RNGs: a single photon RNG and a pair of photons RNG. Our result may have important implication for practical quantum random number generators.},

@article{Marangon,
	abstract = {Secure random numbers are a fundamental element of many applications in science, statistics, cryptography and more in general in security protocols. We present a method that enables the generation of high-speed unpredictable random numbers from the quadratures of an electromag- netic field without any assumption on the input state. The method allows to eliminate the numbers that can be predict due the presence of classical and quantum side information. In particular, we introduce a procedure to estimate a bound on the conditional min-entropy based on the Entropic Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum observables of infinite dimensional quantum sys- tems. By the above method, we experimentally demonstrated the generation of secure true random bits at a rate greater than 1 Gbit/s.},
