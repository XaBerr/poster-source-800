	% 	\justifying
	% 	{\textbf{Polarization} encoding has been extensively used
	% 		for QKD along free-space, optical fiber, and satellite links.
	% 		However, the polarization encoders used in such implementations are \textbf{unstable}, expensive, and can even
	% 		exhibit insecure \textbf{side channels}. Here we propose a \textbf{self-compensating} polarization
	% 		encoder based on a $LiNbO_3$ phase modulator inside
	% 		a \textbf{Sagnac} interferometer and implement it using only commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components.} %Our polarization
	% 	%encoder combines a simple design and high stability reaching an intrinsic quantum bit error rate as low as $0.2\%$.
	% 	%Since realization is possible from the 800 to the 1550 nm
	% 	%band using COTS devices, our polarization modulator is a
	% 	%promising solution for free-space, fiber, and satellite-based
	% 	%QKD}

					%We extract secure random numbers from the measure of the quadratures of an unknown state of the EM field (usually the vacuum). 
					\vskip -2cm
					\hskip 1cm \textbf{Features:}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item \textbf{Long term stability}: Thermal and mechanical phase drifts  are automatically compensated \\
						\item Phase modulator needs to support \textbf{only one polarization}\\
						\item \textbf{Low $V_\pi$}: no need to modulate the relative phase\\
					\end{itemize}

					\vskip1.5cm
					\textbf{\hskip1cm  Working principle: }
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The qubits enter with $\ket{D}$ state into a polarization maintaining (PM) fiber where it get an elliptical phase $\delta$  \\
						\item A fiber Polarization Beam Splitter (PBS) \textbf{splits} the light into two \textbf{orthogonal polarizations}, guided by PM fibers \\
						\item Both beams are \textbf{aligned to the slow axis} of the PM fiber. The polarization degree of freedom is mapped to the optical path of the photons. From now, \textbf{only one polarization travels in the loop}.\\
						      \vskip 0.3cm
						\item The phase modulator, placed \textbf{asymmetrically}, can add a \textbf{$\phi_e$} to the \textbf{Clockwise} pulse and a \textbf{$\phi_\ell$} shift to the \textbf{Counter-clockwise} pulse. \\

						\item At the PBS the pulses are recombined
						\item The qubits entering again in the polarization maintaining (PM) fiber with swapped $H, V$ components getting an elliptical phase $-\delta$
						\item The final state is ${\ket{\psi_\mathrm{out}}  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \ket{H} + e^{i(\phi_e-\phi_\ell)} \ket{V} \right]}$
